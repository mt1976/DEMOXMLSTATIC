  If we have more than one undelying, then must be a cross. Note this
  is a spot deal, so all side rates and crosses are spot (no need for CFI).
  
  Logic:
    assert first dealt-cross spot rate
    process GBP/JPY cross
    if more
      process GBP/USD
      process USD/JPY
  
  Desc: SP meaning these are spot components
  FxRate: The price
  Px: The absolute margin (derived if cross)
