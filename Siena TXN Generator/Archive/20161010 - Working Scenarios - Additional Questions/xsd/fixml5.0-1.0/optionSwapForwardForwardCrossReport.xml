  The cross and side rate information. This comes in three parts:

      SP USD/JPY
      
      leg 2 GBP/JPY
      leg 2 GBP/USD
      leg 2 USD/JPY
      
    tom/next would have
      SP  GBP/JPY
      SP  GBP/USD
      SP  USD/JPY
      
      leg 1 GBP/JPY
      leg 1 GBP/USD
      leg 1 USD/JPY
    
    
    The three sections are identifed by the Desc attribute which is:
      SP meaning spot component
      Leg1  meaning leg one component
      Leg2  meaning leg two component

  we have a cross. This example is forward/forward so all component are included

  Desc:   Identifies what the underlying rate refers to.
  Sym:    Currency pair of the price
  FxRate: The price
  Px:     Margin (derived if cross)
  CFI:    RCSXXX=SPOT, FFCPN0=FORWARD
  Mat:    Maurity date. Used to give a date for the rate. Where Desc is SP,
  this is the spot date
