  The cross and side rate information. This comes in three parts:
    1. All Spot prices
    2. All leg one prices
    3. All leg two prices
    
    Where leg one is spot or leg two is spot the leg information is ommited.
    For example spot/forward
    
    Would have
      SP GBP/JPY
      SP GBP/USD
      SP USD/JPY
      
      leg 2 GBP/JPY
      leg 2 GBP/USD
      leg 2 USD/JPY
      
    tom/next would have
      SP  GBP/JPY
      SP  GBP/USD
      SP  USD/JPY
      
      leg 1 GBP/JPY
      leg 1 GBP/USD
      leg 1 USD/JPY
    
    
    The three sections are identifed by the Desc attribute which is:
      SP meaning spot component
      Leg1  meaning leg one component
      Leg2  meaning leg two component
-->
<!--
  First we describe spot components. Where this is greater than 1, then we know
  we have a cross. This example is forward/forward so all component are included

  Desc:   Identifies what the underlying rate refers to.
  
  FxRate: The price
  Px:     Margin (derived if cross)
  CFI:    RCSXXX=SPOT, FFCPN0=FORWARD
  Mat:    Maurity date. Used to give a date for the rate. Where Desc is SP, this is the spot date
