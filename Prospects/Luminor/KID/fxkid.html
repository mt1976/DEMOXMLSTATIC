<h1>WHAT IS THIS PRODUCT?</h1>
<h2>TYPE</h2>
Rolling FX Spot is a contract where the profit it to be secured or loss avoided by reference to fluctuations in an underlying currency pair, such the Euro (<strong>EUR</strong>) against the U.S. Dollar (<strong>USD</strong>), referred to as <strong>EURUSD</strong>, for immediate delivery.
<br><br>Visit our website <a href="https://eurobase.com">here</a> for further information in relation to the underlying currency pairs available.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
The objective of trading Rolling FX Spot is to gain exposure to fluctuations related to the underlying currency pair without owning it. Your return depends on the size of the performance (or movement) of the underlying currency pair and the size of your position. This product is entered into for the purpose of speculation or hedging and is commonly traded on margin. Margin refers to the use of a small amount of capital to support an investment of a larger exposure. Please note that margin trading requires extra caution, because whilst you can realise large profits if the price moves in your favour, you risk extensive losses if the price moves against you.

<h2>TERM</h2>
